# CAPP Dataset: Context Aware Polite Paraphrase Dataset

[![CC BY-NC-SA 4.0][cc-by-nc-sa-shield]][cc-by-nc-sa]

This repository contains information about the ***Context Aware Polite Paraphrase (CAPP) dataset*** - a dialogue-style corpus of rude utterances and corresponding polite paraphrases, with samples accompanied by additional context in the form of prior two turns from the dialogue. The original paper [**Demonstrations Are All You Need: Advancing Offensive Content Paraphrasing using In-Context Learning**][Arxiv Paper] was accepted in [ACL 2024 Findings][ACL 2024].

In addition to the CAPP dataset, we also provide the generated paraphrases for the different methods described in the paper.
